radiation given off by the earth the suns radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earths atmosphere and lands on the earths surface where  of it is absorbed  is reflected back into the atmosphere part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth the greenhouses gases ghgs are water vapor ho carbon dioxide co nitrous oxide no and methane ch\\n\\nhow long does co remain in the atmosphere this is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere from  to  of the co that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of  years the rest is removed over several hundred thousand years according to the ipcc fourth assessment report about  of co increase will be removed from the atmosphere within  years another  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years this means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years methane ch by contrast persists for about  years thus even though methane is  times more potent than carbon dioxide its effect is relatively shortlived furthermore methane has increased from  ppb in  to  ppb today notice that is parts per billion not parts per million\\n\\nif the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming how much will the earth warm up by the year  this depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere as a general rule about  trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere actually  billion will translate to about  ppm of additional carbon dioxide also  ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about  f  c in global warming this can be verified by the fact that preindustrial carbon dioxide was about  ppm and is now about  ppm during this period the planet warmed up about  c\\n\\nscientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to  ppm and have found that this corresponds to  billion metric tons of co in the atmosphere therefore in order to increase the global temperature by  c you would need  x  billion or  billion metric tons of carbon dioxide a metric ton equals  kilograms or  x    pounds the us is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton in  the world pumped  billion metric tons or  us gt of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere the average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is  metric tons per person per year in the year  there will be about  billion people therefore in  in a businessasusual scenario we can expect the world to emit  x  or  billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of  billion tons for the next  years ie an accumulation of  trillion tons of co by   less   tt due to carbon sinks the oceans are almost saturated with co the world will have an accumulation of tt    of carbon in the atmosphere dividing  trillion tons of co by  million   c  f  this means that the world will be  f warmer in  than it was in \\n\\nthe rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes water expansions  feet due to the added  f of increased temperature and melting ice mainly from greenland  feet and the antarctica  feet or  total feet by  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation   although we do not usually notice it water expands very slightly as it gets warmer the second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice antarctica has  of the ice greenland has  of the ice  trillion tons of ice and the remaining  is tied up in continental glaciers which except for the himalayas will all melt by   if greenland completely melts it will raise the sea level by about  feet  meters  if the antarctica completely melts it will add  feet or  meters to the sea level rise   \\n\\nin the year  i predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted coal may last until  and that the temperature rise will level off my model predicts that greenland will be losing about  gt of ice per year until the end of the century resulting in about  feet of sea level rise by   in addition the antarctica will add another  feet of sea level rise adding this to the  feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of  feet  now add  feet due to melting of the west antarctic ice sheet wais due to the collapse of the pine island and thwaites glaciers and you have a  foot sea level rise by the end of the century  noaa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration states that the oceans could rise  feet by  under a worsecase scenario namely a complete collapse of the wais  \\n\\nwhat effect would a  foot sea level rise have on the us miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas about  million americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just  feet if the sea level rises  feet  million americans would see their homes permanently flooded a new study predicts that as many as  million americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by  if the sea level rises  feet  meters which is what i expect to be the most likely scenario\\n\\nin addition to sealevel rise global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insectborne illnesses and cropdamaging pests for example diseases such as zika dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period which means the disease can spread more rapidly warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects\\n\\nglobal warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans energy is what drives weather while we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming we can tie an overall trend to global warming it makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather generally hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about  f  c the longer the ocean waters stay above  f the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom\\n\\nlastly global warming will result in more droughts floods and water scarcity  demand for water has tripled during the past  years currently a half billion people live in a waterstressed country by  that number is expected to increase to about  billion the vast majority of fresh water about  is used for agriculture on the us east coast much of the water supply comes from surface water whereas most of the midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water the well water comes from underground aquifers such as the ogallala aquifer at present rates of withdrawal parts of the ogallala aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another  to  years', 'no to plastic pollution', 'i was born in  and spend a lot of time outdoors  its getting hotter and storms are getting more intense', 'we all have to move to the sahara desert and use solar energy very few trees to cut down in the

basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earths atmosphere and lands on the earths surface where  of it is absorbed  is reflected back into the atmosphere part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth the greenhouses gases ghgs are water vapor ho carbon dioxide co nitrous oxide no and methane ch\\n\\nhow long does co remain in the atmosphere this is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere from  to  of the co that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of  years the rest is removed over several hundred thousand years according to the ipcc fourth assessment report about  of co increase will be removed from the atmosphere within  years another  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years this means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years methane ch by contrast persists for about  years thus even though methane is  times more potent than carbon dioxide its effect is relatively shortlived furthermore methane has increased from  ppb in  to  ppb today notice that is parts per billion not parts per million\\n\\nif the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming how much will the earth warm up by the year  this depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere as a general rule about  trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere actually  billion will translate to about  ppm of additional carbon dioxide also  ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about  f  c in global warming this can be verified by the fact that preindustrial carbon dioxide was about  ppm and is now about  ppm during this period the planet warmed up about  c\\n\\nscientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to  ppm and have found that this corresponds to  billion metric tons of co in the atmosphere therefore in order to increase the global temperature by  c you would need  x  billion or  billion metric tons of carbon dioxide a metric ton equals  kilograms or  x    pounds the us is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton in  the world pumped  billion metric tons or  us gt of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere the average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is  metric tons per person per year in the year  there will be about  billion people therefore in  in a businessasusual scenario we can expect the world to emit  x  or  billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of  billion tons for the next  years ie an accumulation of  trillion tons of co by   less   tt due to carbon sinks the oceans are almost saturated with co the world will have an accumulation of tt    of carbon in the atmosphere dividing  trillion tons of co by  million   c  f  this means that the world will be  f warmer in  than it was in \\n\\nthe rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes water expansions  feet due to the added  f of increased temperature and melting ice mainly from greenland  feet and the antarctica  feet or  total feet by  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation   although we do not usually notice it water expands very slightly as it gets warmer the second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice antarctica has  of the ice greenland has  of the ice  trillion tons of ice and the remaining  is tied up in continental glaciers which except for the himalayas will all melt by   if greenland completely melts it will raise the sea level by about  feet  meters  if the antarctica completely melts it will add  feet or  meters to the sea level rise   \\n\\nin the year  i predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted coal may last until  and that the temperature rise will level off my model predicts that greenland will be losing about  gt of ice per year until the end of the century resulting in about  feet of sea level rise by   in addition the antarctica will add another  feet of sea level rise adding this to the  feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of  feet  now add  feet due to melting of the west antarctic ice sheet wais due to the collapse of the pine island and thwaites glaciers and you have a  foot sea level rise by the end of the century  noaa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration states that the oceans could rise  feet by  under a worsecase scenario namely a complete collapse of the wais  \\n\\nwhat effect would a  foot sea level rise have on the us miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas about  million americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just  feet if the sea level rises  feet  million americans would see their homes permanently flooded a new study predicts that as many as  million americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by  if the sea level rises  feet  meters which is what i expect to be the most likely scenario\\n\\nin addition to sealevel rise global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insectborne illnesses and cropdamaging pests for example diseases such as zika dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period which means the disease can spread more rapidly warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects\\n\\nglobal warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans energy is what drives weather while we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming we can tie an overall trend to global warming it makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather generally hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about  f  c the longer the ocean waters stay above  f the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom\\n\\nlastly global warming will result in more droughts floods and water scarcity  demand for water has tripled during the past  years currently a half billion people live in a waterstressed country by  that number is expected to increase to about  billion the vast majority of fresh water about  is used for agriculture on the us east coast much of the water supply comes from surface water whereas most of the midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water the well water comes from underground aquifers such as the ogallala aquifer at present rates of withdrawal parts of the ogallala aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another  to  years', 'is co earths thermostat\\ncarbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming co is currently traced at  ppm that is one carbondioxide molecule for every  parts of the atmosphere humans contribute only a scant  ppm which is  of the total co accumulated in a year co only holds heat for a few seconds and there is not enough of it to drive climate change it is thermodynamically impossible\\nalso bear in mind that water vapor is the earths most abundant and effective greenhouse gas co is only  of the earths chg water vapor is  of the earths ghg and holds heat far longer than co\\nlastly co will increase only after temperatures rise eg el nino and oceans degas conversely co levels drop as temperatures cool in other words co levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow
